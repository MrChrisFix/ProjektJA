# ASM & C++ Sobel operator
<h3> Abstract </h3>
This program is a student project for assembly classes at my university. It is a GUI programm that calculates edges using the Sobel operator.

<h3> Objective </h3>
The objective of the project was to write a multithread programm in C++ or C# and 2 DLLs: one in C++ or C and the second in assembly with usage of vector instructions. My Topic was the edge detection using the Sobel operator.
The goal is to learn assembly and to show that assembly CAN be faster than C++ or other programming languages.

<h3> How to use this </h3>
The programm is designed to <b>run only in x64</b>. The proramm has an user interface. <s>The programm default langiage is english, but you can it change by using the menu bar.</s> First you have to open a picture by using the manu bar(only .bmp 24bpp working now). Then choose the dll you want to use and the number of threads(max 64). Next click start and wait for the result üòÅ. <s>You can then save the created pictrue.</s> 

<h3>What is already done</h3>

* GUI
* Opening the images (bitmap 24bpp)
* C++ DLL

<h3>What isn't done yet</h3>

* Assembly DLL
* Languages
* Saving the calculated image
* Progress bar
* More image formats?
